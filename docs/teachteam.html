  <h2>NUvention Web 2017 Teaching Team</h2>
    <h3>
      <small>The NUvention Web Teaching team combines industry and academic experience</small>
    </h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.farley.northwestern.edu/we-teach/nuvention/web-and-media.html">NUvention Web</a> is a course offered jointly by the Farley Center in the McCormick School School of Engineering and the Medill School of Journalism.
    It's mission is to provide students with a curricular experience that simulates an internet or internet media startup over 20 weeks.  Students work extensively to identify an opportunity, build a prototype, test a business model, and launch on the 
    web; getting real customers and real feedback on their execution.   
    
    We are well supported by our incredible set of <a href="/tateam.html">teaching assistants</a> that help make the course work
